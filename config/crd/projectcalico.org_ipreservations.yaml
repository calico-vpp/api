        description: IPReservation allows certain IP addresses to be reserved (i.e.
          prevented from being allocated) by Calico IPAM.  Reservations only block
          new allocations, they do not cause existing IP allocations to be released.
          The current implementation is only suitable for reserving small numbers
          of IP addresses relative to the size of the IP pool.  If large portions
          of an IP pool are reserved, Calico IPAM may hunt for a long time to find
          a non-reserved IP.
